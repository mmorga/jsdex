# Jsdex

Builds an text index of a set of files (such as the posts for a blog)
and provides a JavaScript library that allows searching of the index
on the browser to return search results. 

This is intended for use in static site generators like Jekyll and 
Octopress and for use in places where an external search site would
not have access to spider the generated site (such as within on an
intranet).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'jsdex'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
